TO-DO:
------

* generally, various:
  - finalize logging (incl. tests and using it)
  - documentation (Magena.pod and references to it from other modules)
  - test more "no hits found"
  - prepare installation document
    - including javascript links to Google site?
  - test for Javascript? how?
  - try with another BLAST (EBI, NCBI...)
  - more checks for what database we have (tr is not the only one that can be there)
  - subpanel should "inherit" from panel (and the same for dbpanel)
  - this should not be in the code: "ac:$qid"
  - test with other browsers
  - config panel
  - improve: error should go to users, not just to the apache log
    (perhaps a panel showing last errorrs form the server?)
  - better style and API for dialogs (messages, confirmations)
     http://dev.iceburg.net/jquery/jqModal/
     http://projectshadowlight.org/jquery-easy-confirm-dialog/
  - grep TBDs
  ! resolve the issue where to specify /data in ../datadir
    (incl. mollify/backend/configuration.php)
  - deal with nasty files names (with command and quotes)

* subpanel:
  - manage taxonomy (species); graphs?

* panel:
  - indicate what was already saved last time (cookies?)
  - browser back button(s) when there is an unsaved work

* file manager:
  - try Plupload (because of chunking downloads)
  - try multi-user mode
  - how to run Admin mode?


TO-DO for Commons:
------------------
* documentation
? replace Config::Simple by Config::General
* Config.pm could/should make replacements of {other.property.name}
* better error handling...
