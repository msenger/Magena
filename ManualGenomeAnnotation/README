Magena - Manual Genome Annotation

A set of modules and a web interface helping bio-curators to manually
create sequence annotations into GFF files from various automatic
analysis tools (such as BLAST and InterproScan).

INSTALLATION (of only Perl modules)

The Perl modules can be installed by running the following commands:

	perl Makefile.PL [INSTALL_BASE=/where/to/install]
	make
	make test
	make install

However, these steps do not install the web interface. And installing
the web interface (as documented below) does not necessarily need to
have the Perl modules installed in their usual places.

INSTALLATION (of everything, including the web interface)

...to be written (better, more)... but for now:

1) Unpack the distribution file. It creates directory
   Magena-<version>. Consider it a "PROJECT-HOME" (in the next
   instructions).

Perl
----

2) Install Perl modules listed as dependencies in
   "PROJECT-HOME/Makefile.PL". If you used the regular installation of
   Perl modules (as shown above), the missing dependencies will be
   shown. Here they are, as well:

      Config::Simple
      JSON
      Log::Log4Perl
      Template
      MRS::Client

   It should be enough for Perl 5.10.1. For Perl 5.10 there are few
   other dependencies (to be installed):

      File::Temp
      File::Slurp
      File::Path
      parent

3) You need to have BioPerl on your machine. The needed version is
   1.6.9 and above - but such version is not yet (July 2010) available
   on CPAN. Therefore, take it from the git repository:

      cd /somewhere/bioperl-live
      git clone git://github.com/bioperl/bioperl-live.git

   Make sure that you set this location into your PERL5LIB environment
   variable (important below in the Apache configuration).

4) Check and edit "lib/magena.cfg". Important lines are:

   These lines must comply with your Apache server configuration (see
   more in the next step):

      root.doc = /magena-doc
      root.cgi = /magena/start

   These lines tells about your MRS local installation (if any):
      mrs.host = 10.75.106.25
      tr.mrs.url = http://10.75.106.25:8080/mrs-web/query.do?db=trembl&query=ac:%s
      ...

   This defines a directory where the Magena web application reads
   user data from and where it saves them back. If you keep
   directories 'cgi-bin' and 'datadir' on the same level (as it is in
   your "PROJECT-HOME" now), you may leave it as it is.

       root.data = ../datadir

PHP
---

   The file manager in Magena is written in PHP. If you wish to use it
   (it is convenient but not crucial), you have to have PHP installed
   in your Apache server, and you have make (very little) additional
   configuration:

   If you do not want to or cannot use PHP with your Apache server,
   disable the Magena file manager in "magena.cfg":

      [fmanager]
      enabled = 0

5) Copy
      "web/html/mollify/backend/configuration.php.template"
   into
      "web/html/mollify/backend/configuration.php".

   Edit "web/html/mollify/backend/configuration.php":

   - Change the hostname there. And the full path to the place with
     data. This should be a full path to the
     "PROJECT-HOME/web/datadir/data".

6) The file uploader (a part of the Magena file manager) has limits
   that are defined in your PHP configuration. You can see what are
   the current values if you try to upload a file (usually, the
   default maximum size of an uploaded file is 2MB). You may consider
   to change the following properties (in the global PHP configuration
   file that usually is "/etc/php5/apache2/php.ini"):

      ; Maximum allowed size for uploaded files.
      ; http://php.net/upload-max-filesize
      ; upload_max_filesize = 2M
      upload_max_filesize = 10M

      ; Maximum number of files that can be uploaded via a single request
      max_file_uploads = 20

      ; Maximum total upload size (all files combined)
      post_max_size = 20M

Apache server
-------------

7) Configure your Apache server:

   a) Make sure that the directory "PROJECT-HOME/web/html" is
   accessible as a document directory (under the name specify above by
   property "root.doc").

   b) Make sure that the directory "PROJECT-HOME/web/cgi-bin" is
   accessible as a script directory (under the name specify above by
   property "root.cgi").

   For example, in (usually) "/etc/apache2/httpd.conf", do this
   (change PROJECT-HOME to your full path):

      ### Magena
      <Directory "PROJECT-HOME/web/html/">
         Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews
         AllowOverride None
         Order allow,deny
         allow from all
      </Directory>

      <Directory "PROJECT-HOME/web/cgi-bin">
	 AllowOverride None
	 Options +ExecCGI -MultiViews +SymLinksIfOwnerMatch
	 Order allow,deny
	 Allow from all
      </Directory>

      ### Aliases
      <IfModule alias_module>
         Alias /magena-doc/ "PROJECT-HOME/web/html/"
         ScriptAlias /magena/ "PROJECT-HOME/web/cgi-bin/"
      </IfModule> 

   c) Make sure that your Apache server knows about Magena Perl
   libraries (and about your BioPerl installation). Either regularly
   install them (as shown at the beginning of this document) - or,
   recommended, set an environment variable in your Apache (usually in
   the same file as in the last bullet):

      setenv PERL5LIB "PROJECT-HOME/lib:/somewhere/bioperl-live"

   d) The files in "PROJECT-HOMEweb/datadir/data" will be managed by
   the user who runs the Apache server. Therefore, they must have
   proper permissions and/or ownership. For example:

      sudo chown -R www-data:www-data PROJECT-HOME/web/datadir/data

Done
----

8) I think it is... (assuming that other things, such as location of
   your Perl executable, are normal; that you are not using mod_perl -
   which may work but I have not tested it yet, etc., etc.).

   Start your browser and point it to (the URL depends, of course, how
   you configured it):

      http://localhost/magena/start


SUPPORT AND DOCUMENTATION

After installing, you can find documentation for this module with the
perldoc command.
