<p>Welcome to the Help Angel...</p>

<p>Where ever you see my face <img src="[% site.url.images %]/help_view.gif" border="0"/>

- well, except in this paragraph - hover your mouse over it and I will
try to explain what can or should happen around.</p>

<p>Sometimes, especially near the bottom of the screen, my help
tooltip may not be fully visible. In such case, or in any other,
click on the Help button you are just now very close to, and all
tooltips will be displayed on a separate page.</p>

<p>Please, enjoy the ride. Your Angel.</p>

<div [% tooltip ('supernote-note-genmanager') %]>
<h5>Basic identification</h5>

<p>Here you specify basic identification that will be shared by all
annotations (in each <em>Save</em> batch) and will be injected into
resulting GFF files.</p>

<p>The values are remembered for the next time (if you have not
disabled cookies in your browser).</p>

<p>The <b>source</b> is a free text qualifier intended to describe the
algorithm or operating procedure that generated this
annotation. Typically this is the name of a piece of software, such as
<em>Genescan</em> or a database name, such as <em>Genbank</em>.</p>

<p>The <b>type</b> of the feature is constrained to be either:
<ul class="tooltip-list">

  <li> a term from the <em>lite</em> version of the Sequence Ontology
  - SOFA,</li>

  <li> a term from the full Sequence Ontology - it must be an
  <em>is_a</em> child of sequence_feature (SO:0000110),</li>

  <li> or a SOFA or SO accession number. The latter alternative is
  distinguished using the syntax SO:000000.</li>

</ul>
</p>

<p>The field <em>Modified</em> may be also used as a calendar <img
src="[% site.url.images %]/smile.gif" border="0"/> if you uncheck
<em>Use real date</em>.

<div [% tooltip ('supernote-note-splitblast') %]>
<h5>Splitting BLAST results</h5>

<p>Sometimes it is more convenient to work with smaller BLAST results
file. Such file loads faster into the annotating pages.</p>

<p>Caveat is that you need to deal with more files. Therefore, one of
the split options is to specify <em>directory for resulting files</em>
which makes file navigation slightly easier. You can select from all
available directories in your <em>data</em> space. If you need to
create a new directory, close this page, open <em>Manage files &amp;
folders</em>, create whatever folder you like and return back to this
page.</p>

<p>You can also specify up to how many query sequences to keep in one
split result. Default value is 5.</p>

<p>Of course, you need to tell <em>what file to split</em>. Select one
by browsing the familiar file manager.</p>

<p>Finally, press the button <em>Split</em>.</p>

<div [% tooltip ('supernote-note-inputs') %]>
<h5>Providing inputs to your annotations</h5>

<p>Any annotation tool, such as BLAST results, definitely needs an
input file. For BLAST results, not surprisingly, the input is a file
with BLAST results. </p>

<p>You do not type the file name but rather select one by browsing the
files of your data space on the server side. Once selected, its name
appears in the otherwise disabled text field here.</p>

<p>You may also <b>upload</b> a file or files from your computer. For
that, click on <em>Manage files &amp; folders</em>. Once uploaded, you
go again to the file browser, find your file and select it.</p>

<p>The last used file will be remembered when you open Magena page
again next time (assuming you did not disabled cookies in your
browser).</p>

<h5>Naming outputs of your annotations</h5>

<p>You will be able to <b>download</b> (<em>save</em>) the results of your
work. The file name that will be used (or suggested) for downloaded
data will be generated from the input file name and from the current
date - but you may change it by unchecking <em>Generate name</em> and
typing your favorite name.</p>

<p>Downloaded data are also always <b>saved on the server side</b> -
again using similar scenario for their file names. Such file never
overwrites another file with the same name - it just adds some numbers
to the new name. Directory name where the data are saved can be
configured, with the default name being unimaginatively
<em>SavedOutputs</em>.</p>

<div [% tooltip ('supernote-note-addfiles') %]>
<h5>Selecting more input files</h5>

<p>There may be times when you wish to combine content of more input
files and annotate them together. For example, you want to see BLAST
results from more result files in the same panel.</p>

<p>First, select the first file, as usual, and then check the checkbox
<em>Add more input files</em> and start selecting additional
files. You can clear the list (and start building another one) by
unchecking the checkbox</p>

<p> The list (usually containing just one file, but there is no upper
limit) will be used once you click on the <em>Start</em> button in any
of the available annotation tools.</p>

</div>

<div [% tooltip ('supernote-note-br') %]>
<h5>Annotations based on BLAST results</h5>

<p>The <em>Start</em> button (or the small triangle <img src="[%
site.url.images %]/triangle-closed.gif" border="0"/>) loads a file
with BLAST results of the query sequences you are going to
annotate. The open panel can be close and open again by a small
triangle <img src="[% site.url.images %]/triangle-open.gif"
border="0"/>. Your work is not saved until the button <em>Save</em> is
used. Before saving to a file the GFF result can be seen by the
<em>Show</em> button.</p>

<p>The open panel shows lines with query sequences - each of them has
its own sub-panel where the real annotation happens. The sub-panel is
open either by clicking on the <em>Sequence ID</em> or on a small
triangle <img src="[% site.url.images %]/triangle-closed.gif"
border="0"/>. Type your annotation in the text fields, or copy data
there from one cell (<img src="[% site.url.images %]/arrowup.gif"
border="0"/>) or from the whole line (<img src="[% site.url.images
%]/copyline.gif" border="0"/>).</p>

<p>You can open more sub-panels by the <img src="[% site.url.images
%]/expandall.gif" border="0"/> (in case of more that 40 query
sequences you need to click the icon more than once - but it is more
convenient, and safer, to work with less sequences at the time,
anyway). The <img src="[% site.url.images %]/collapseall.gif"
border="0"/> icon closes all panels, the same way as a small triangle
<img src="[% site.url.images %]/triangle-open.gif" border="0" /> does
it for any individual panel.</p>

<p>Once you change anything in the annotation fields the icon <img
src="[% site.url.images %]/edited.gif" border="0" /> appears on the
left, indicating that this panel was visited and has unsaved
content. On the other hand, the icon <img src="[% site.url.images
%]/saved.gif" border="0" /> indicates that your annotations have been
saved. If a query sequence has both these icons shown it means that it
was saved at least once in this session but after that it has been
again further edited.</p>

<p>Last but not least, clicking on a <em>ID of the hit</em> sequence
opens a new window with the original sequence. You can also see the
raw BLAST result for any particular query sequence by clicking on the
<em>raw result</em>.</p>
