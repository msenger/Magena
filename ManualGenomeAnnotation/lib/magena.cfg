# properties used when parsing and using Blast results
# ----------------------------------------------------
[blast]

# Blast hits have IDs indicating from which databases they
# are. Examples of such IDs are:
#
#    gi|261264910|gb|GQ983543.1|
#    UNIPROT:VSPH_TRIJE
#    tr_Q1D632_Q1D632_MYXXD
#
# The following properties help to parse such IDs and to extract from
# them the DB part and the real ID part.
#
# Use property "id.separator" for the uniform Blast results. If such
# property does not exist, the Magena parser will use
# "id.separator.regex" to find a character that will be used as a
# separator (this regex should have, therefore, a group (parenthesis)
# defined).

#id.separator = |
#id.separator = :
#id.separator = _
id.separator.regex = ([|_:])

# Blast hits has also a description that may contains gene name and
# organism. Below are few examples of descriptions. Each of them is
# followed by regular expressions for retrieving organism, gene name
# and description itself. You have to make just one set available by
# setting property "desc.type.prefix" to value equal to prefix of
# properties defining regular expressions for the selected type. Note
# that the name of the current property group (in this case "blast")
# is part of the prefix.
#
desc.type.prefix = blast.kaust
#desc.type.prefix = blast.ebi
#desc.type.prefix = blast.ncbi

# From EBI blast:
#  BOZT25 Venom serine proteinase OS=Trimeresurus gramineus GN=TLG2A PE=2 SV=1
#
#  where organism is 'Trimeresurus gramineus', gene name is 'TLG2A',
#  and description itself is 'Venom serine proteinase'. All these
#  regular expressions should return one matching group.

# SO:000000.
